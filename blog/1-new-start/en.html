<h1>Start a blog on my nook</h1>
<p>Welcome to my piece of the internet! This is my first blog post, which is part of my project. I will try to post some useful information here from time to time, but I don't promise that it will be regular. </p>
<p>You can mainly expect posts in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Linux</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Web development</li>
    <li>My projects</li>
    <li>Other interesting things that interest me</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fresh start from the old site, as I needed new changes</p>
